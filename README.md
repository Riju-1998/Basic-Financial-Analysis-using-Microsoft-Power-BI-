# Basic-Financial-Analysis-using-Microsoft-Power-BI-
In this project, I conducted a basic financial analysis using Microsoft Power BI, a powerful business analytics tool. The aim was to leverage Power BI's functionalities to gain insights into financial data, identify trends, and make informed business decisions.
Project Deliverables:

Dashboard showcasing key financial KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) such as revenue, expenses, profitability ratios, etc.
Visualizations illustrating trends over time for different financial metrics.
Comparative analysis charts to compare financial performance across different periods or business units.
Written report summarizing findings and recommendations derived from the analysis.
Future Enhancements:

Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast future financial performance.
Integrate real-time data sources for up-to-date insights.
Enhance dashboard interactivity for user-driven exploration of financial data.
